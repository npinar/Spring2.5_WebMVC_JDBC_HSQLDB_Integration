I developed this application by Developing a Spring Framework MVC application step-by-step tutorial. I modified it to make it simpler and also
added comments to explain the steps. This example also shows how you can use Spring's JDBC framework with HSQL open source
database. Spring's JDBC framework allows you to not worry about opening and closing the connections. Also, you do not
have to catch nasty exceptions. Spring framework wraps SQL exceptions in it's own unchecked exception. You can also see
how Spring framework makes handling transactions easy with using AOP for transaction advice and an ApectJ pointcuts.
